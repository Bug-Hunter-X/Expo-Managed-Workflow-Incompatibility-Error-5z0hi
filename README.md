# Expo Managed Workflow Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when developing with Expo's managed workflow: incompatibility with certain features or modules.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers solutions.

## Problem:

Attempting to use features or libraries that require direct native interaction within Expo's managed workflow may result in runtime errors or unexpected behavior. This is because Expo's managed workflow abstracts away many native interactions for ease of development, but limits lower-level access.

## Solution:

Solutions usually involve:

1. **Using Expo-provided alternatives:** Many native-like functionalities have Expo equivalents.  Check the Expo documentation to see if an alternative exists.
2. **Ejecting from Expo:**  For complete control over native modules, you can eject from the managed workflow to use Expo's bare workflow.  However, this significantly increases complexity. 
3. **Using a compatible library:**  Choose libraries explicitly designed for Expo's managed workflow. 
4. **Custom Native Modules (Advanced):** For very specific cases, you could create a custom native module, but this is typically the most complex approach.
