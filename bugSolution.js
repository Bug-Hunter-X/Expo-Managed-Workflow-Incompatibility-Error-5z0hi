The solution depends on the specific module causing the problem. Let's assume the bug was using a camera library not fully compatible with Expo's managed workflow.

**bug.js (Problematic Code):**
```javascript
import { Camera } from 'react-native-camera-xyz'; //Incompatible Library

// ... code using the incompatible camera library ...
```

**bugSolution.js (Solution):**
```javascript
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera'; //Expo's camera module

// ... use Expo's Camera module correctly ...
// Ensure necessary permissions are requested
```

Remember to install the correct Expo module:
```bash
expo install expo-camera
```
If the issue persists, thoroughly review the error messages and consult the documentation for the specific library or module to find alternative approaches or compatibility information.
