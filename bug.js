This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or module in Expo that isn't compatible with the managed workflow you're using.  Expo's managed workflow simplifies development by abstracting away many native modules, but it limits access to some lower-level functionalities.  If you try to import or use a module that requires direct native interaction, this error can manifest.

For example, if you're using a library that interacts directly with the device's camera or filesystem in a way that Expo's managed workflow can't handle, you might get this error.  Attempting to use certain third-party native modules without proper Expo integration can also trigger this.
